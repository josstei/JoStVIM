# JoStVIM - A Customized VIM Environment for Java Development

## Overview

Welcome to **JoStVIM**, a personal VIM configuration designed to create a clear, concise, and easy entry point for using VIM as a Java development environment. This project not only aims to enhance my understanding of VIM, but also to provide a highly efficient and user-friendly VIM setup that caters specifically to Java development need.

## Purpose

As a newcomer to VIM, this project is a step towards improving my workflow and learning more about the powerful customization features VIM offers. 

The goal of this setup is not only to create an environment that I am comfortable working in, but also to provide an easy-to-use entry point for others looking to use VIM for Java development.
